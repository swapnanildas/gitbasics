### Basic Commands
These are the most basic commands to be used to get started with your github journey.

<ul type='circle'>

<li><code> git init -b main </code>
<br>
Code to initialize .git folder on your local folder. This creates a main (default) branch on the current folder that you are at.
</li>


<li><code>git status</code></li>
After you have creted a main branch on your directory, you would want to verify if git is working or not. The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven’t, and which files aren’t being tracked by Git.

<li><code>alias subl='C:/Program Files/Sublime Text/sublime_text.exe'</code></li>
This is one of the most important commands initially when you are starting out with Git. You would want to assign a default text editor for creating and editing files in your repo. Git bash has a few default editors like <i>vim</i> but you would want to use a more navigable text editor to make your life easier. Post installation of sublime text, type in the code to get you started.
<li><code>subl new_file.txt</code></li>
Create a new_file and add some lines to it.
<li><code>git add .</code></li>
Add the files to the staging area
<li><code>git commit -m "First Commit"</code></li>
Viola! this is your first ever git commit
</ul>
